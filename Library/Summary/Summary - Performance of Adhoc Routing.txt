Performance of Adhoc Network Routing
Written by Putta, Prasad, Ravilla, Nath, Chandra
This paper outlines the different algorithms used for routing in Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANETS). It covers the two reactive algorithms (Adhoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and the main proactive protocol, Optimised Link State Routing (OLSR). These algorithms were compared based on the following three criteria, Packet Delivery Ratio, Mean end-to-end delay and Routing load. The paper shows that for high bandwidth sources, the OLSR protocol allow for the greatest reliability however for low bandwidth sources, the reactive protocols allow for greatest reliability. Neither of the reactive protocols proved to superior.
The paper shows that for high bandwidth applications a proactive approach allows for a better reliability and less bandwidth usage while for any low end usage reactive is the solution. The paper doesnâ€™t explain which layer the protocols run on, or the algorithm specifics.
