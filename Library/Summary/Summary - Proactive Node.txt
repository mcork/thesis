This paper addresses the issues of bandwidth-hogging and time-sensitivity that is required when streaming video over an adhoc network by proposing a new proactive architecture. The paper analyses the re-transmission time and explains how the new architecture handles the incoming packets. The procedure for handling the incoming packets includes checking if the rtt is less than the threshold of delay and if it isn't the packet gets dropped as a smaller path already exisit within the node architecture.The packets that have less delay are selected for retransmission to the next node in the sequence. The loss of packets is handles by an NACK which reduces the ACK messages on the bandwidth.

Through experimental testing the paper proves that the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) is a 2.27dB improvement on the conventional case of 32.67dB. The paper clearly presents an architecture that allows the efficient streaming of video in real time. The strength of this approach is that the data is sent over the quickest path and and thus doesn't flood the network. It also handles the loss of packets effectively. The weaknesss is that as all nodes know if they are part of the quickest route if the structure changes suddenly their is no reducancy for this 
data to get through.

- write in relevance of each paper. Why i should pay attention to it.

- Come up with my own architecture for our system.
- Design an experiment to test some aspect of the architecture.
 

- stuff to find out 
- find out difference betweeen this and dykstras'
