The paper was to investigate the different methods of sharing for the occupancy grid. The three ways investigated was sending the the occupancy grid in sections periodically, sending each cell that changes or sending the data between hosts and allowing the OG to be generated. It was established that the most efficient method of sharing the OG is to send the data itself and allow individual hosts to generate their own OG. 
This method proved to be almost seven times faster than the next sending each cell option and almost seventy times better than sending the sections periodically. The disadvantage of this method is that all hosts need to have the same data to generate this same occupancy grid. Hosts that either join or leave a connection will not have all the same data set and thus will not have a complete occupancy.
