NEXT STEPS
- send a file through the system and open it on the other side -- DONE!!
- make the connection duplex (i.e send/recieve by both people)
	- get read to work before write
- integrate the shared memory
- open data from shared memory and send to the other side
	- Get a file written to shared memory and send it through 
	- Open on other side

Make intelligent design
	- chooses what to send

Scaleable solution increase to more than one
	- more than two connections possibly a while loop
		- Loop through all read and merge data
		- Send to all
		- Send partially to all
