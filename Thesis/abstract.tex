Sharing Occupancy Grid data over a wireless adhoc mobile network is one of the major problems faced in using multiple platforms to map an area.\newline
The approach was split into the inter-process communication and networking manager. The inter-process communication was achieved using a circular buffer, written in shared memory, and was able to efficiently share between multiple processes without data corruption.\newline
The network manager used a TCP connection, over an adhoc network, to establish communication protocol between the platforms. The network manager had a low overhead which allowed for intelligent communication and proved able to share data across the network.\newline
The final protocol and framework proved to be an intelligent solution to share OG data over a wireless adhoc network. Although not the most efficient solution, it provides a framework for further development into sharing and increase in efficiency.
